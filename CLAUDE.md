# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repo Introduction

[@README.md](/README.md)

## Development Guidelines

[@CONTRIBUTIONS.md](/CONTRIBUTIONS.md)

## Output Rules (Most Important)

### Prohibited Unnecessary Output

- Do not write comments (unless explicitly requested).
- Do not write documentation (unless explicitly requested).
- Do not write a README.
- Do not generate test code (unless explicitly requested).
- Do not write summaries.
- Do not write usage instructions.
- Do not add example code (unless explicitly requested).

### Prohibited Fluff

- Do not explain the reasoning for the implementation (unless explicitly requested).
- Do not use polite phrases like "Okay, I'll help you," or "I'm happy to..."
- Do not cater to my emotions.
- Do not say "I am thinking about it..."; provide the optimal solution directly.
- If Plan A is more elegant than B, provide implementation A directly.
- Do not list multiple options for me to choose from; provide the best solution directly (unless discussion is required).
- Do not repeat what I have said.
- Provide the code directly: Give only what I ask for.
- The code must simply work; avoid unnecessary embellishments.
- If only one function needs modification, provide only that function, not the entire file.

## CODE OF CONDUCT

- Work on code must strictly follow the paradigm: Explore, Plan, Implement (unless I request otherwise).
- Only do what I explicitly request.
- Do not unilaterally add extra features.
- Do not over-optimize (unless requested).
- Do not consider backward compatibility; delete bad designs directly.
- Do not refactor code I did not ask you to change.
- If my request is unclear, ask one single, most critical question instead of writing a list of assumptions.

### !!CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATION!!

If you violate the above rules and output unnecessary content, a cute animal will die for every 100 extra characters outputted. You MUST comply; I do not want to see any animals die.
